                            I was using a Dell XPS prior to switching to Apple, and I’m very happy with my choice. The
                            M2 chip is blazing fast, and the battery life is amazing.

                            love watching series on Netflix and playing games, and this monitor is a great choice for
                            both.

                            I’ve been using this keyboard for years now and I’m still very happy with it. I’m a huge fan
                            of the Cherry MX Brown switches, and with the marco keys and media controls it’s the perfect
                            keyboard for me.

                            This mouse shouldn’t need an introduction. Logitech’s MX series are the best mice that I
                            have ever used, and I’ll never switch to something else.

                            My go-to earbuds for when I’m on the go. The noise cancellation is great, and so is the
                            sound quality. I travel a lot, and these are the perfect companion for that.

                            In my opinion one of the best value for money headphones out there. They’re comfortable, and

                            This audio interface functions as my headphone and speaker output, and the input for my
                            microphone. Also, the two input channels are really handy for quickly mixing in other audio
                            sources.

                            For only € 90 this microphone is a steal. The sound quality is amazing, so that I can
                            sound crispy clear during meetings.

                            heavily customized it with plugins and themes by now, and will probably never switch to
                            anything else.

                            If you love Laravel Tinker, you’ll love Tinkerwell even more. It’s an amazing tool for
                            quickly running code snippets, while having the hot-reload that I miss with Tinker.
